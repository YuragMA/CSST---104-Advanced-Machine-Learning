# **Advanced Machine-Learning Course Repository**

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to showing my work in the Advanced Machine Learning course (CSST 104) during the academic year 2023-2024. 

# **About Me**
**Name:** Marivient Alexia R. Yurag

**Age:** 21 years old

**Course:** Bachelor of Science in Computer Science - Section 3B

**Education:** Laguna State Polytechnic University - Sta. Cruz Campus

**Academic Year:** 2023 - 2024

**Instructor:** Mark P. Bernardino, MSCS

# **Overview**

This repository serves as a compilation of my tasks and assessments taken throughout the course. The focus is on practical applications using Python as the primary programming language and Google Colab as the integrated development environment (IDE). Through real-life examples, I explore various concepts such as linear regression, forecasting, time series analysis using the ARIMA Model, and predictive analysis, providing insights into their applications and implementation.
